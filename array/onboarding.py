# 485. Max Consecutive Ones
# https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/

# Approach => In a loop keep count of 1s, then reset count when 0 is encountered. Keep track of max count in res variable. 
# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.  
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space

# class Solution:
#     def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         count = 0
#         res = 0
#         for i in nums:
#             if i == 1:
#                 count += 1
#                 res = max(count, res)
#             else:
#                 count = 0
#         return res
# => The above approach can be optimized slightly by updating maxCount only when 0 is encountered.

# Approach 2 => In a loop keep count of 1s, then when 0 is encountered update maxCount and reset count. Finally return the maximum of maxCount and count to account for the case when array ends with 1s.
# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.  
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space

# class Solution:
#     def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         count = 0
#         maxCount = 0
#         for i in nums:
#             if i == 1:
#                 count += 1
#             else:
#                 maxCount = max(maxCount, count)
#                 count = 0
#         return max(maxCount, count)

# 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-numbers-with-even-number-of-digits/

# Approach => Convert number to string and check length of string is even or not.
# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
# Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of elements in the input array and M is the average number of digits in each number.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space
# class Solution:
#     def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    
#         count = 0
#         for i in nums:
#             if len(str(i)) % 2 == 0:
#                 count += 1
#         return count

# Approach 2 => For this problem: 2 digits: 10 to 99,4 digits: 1000 to 9999, 6 digits: 100000 (maximum allowed by constraints). Each number is checked against these ranges.If it falls into any of them, it must have an even number of digits.
# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space

# class Solution:
#     def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         counter = 0

#         for num in nums:
#             if len(str(num)) % 2 == 0:
#                 counter += 1
#         return counter

# Approach 3 => Using logarithm to count digits digits = floor(log10(num)) + 1 
# COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space

# class Solution:
#     def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         counter = 0
#         for num in nums:
#             digits = int(math.log10(num)) + 1
#             if digits % 2 == 0:
#                 counter += 1
#         return counter
